📁 **Dynamic Data Folder**

Data / Extensions of Site Modules will be saved in this folder.  
Subfolders depending on the site modules deployed folder name will be created here.

You can find much more information for development and use of modules in our documentation. You can find the documentation in the repositories _docs folder.

Happy coding and have a great one!
