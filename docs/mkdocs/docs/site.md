## Site Modules

Website modules can be run as standalone websites or alongside other installed website modules. They can be distributed across various domains and virtual hosts, using integrated functionalities to display many websites with just one instance. This allows for full control over our administration or another administration module, according to your needs!

<div class="alert alert-info">Explore our example site modules to get more insights for developers! Mind the comments in the files as they will help you to understand everything.</div>

### General Information

- Site Modules are fully deployed websites integrated inside this CMS system. They can be extended using script or extension modules.
- **Name** of Site Modules must start with an a-z character and should contain at most 10 characters.
- Lookup our example Site Module in our repository to get more information about development.

### ðŸ‘† Folder Structure

Here you can find the folder structure for Site Modules which can be applied to use core functions and let files automatically be executed. All these folders are optional to create and use. See inside the `_site/_administrator` Module to see implementations and files in different folders with explanations!
