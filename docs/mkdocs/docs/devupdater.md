# Updater

## Core and Admin Module

**Core** and **admin module** updates can also be managed directly via the BugfishCMS admin interface. This provides an easy-to-use, interactive way to apply updates without needing to manually run update scripts. The system will automatically detect when updates are available and guide you through the process, ensuring that your core and admin modules stay up to date with the latest features and improvements.



## Site Modules
The `_update` folder in BugfishCMS is designed to automate the process of updating your database schema and content as new versions of the CMS are released. It contains PHP files that apply database changes necessary to ensure your system stays up to date with the latest build version. This feature streamlines the upgrade process, ensuring that your database structure is always compatible with the most current version of BugfishCMS.

For more detailed information, refer to the **"Site Modules"** section of the BugfishCMS documentation.
